              <h3> My bechalar degary</h3>

              <p>
                I completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree
                from IPS College in Jaipur, from 2021 to 2024. During my three
                years at IPS, I gained comprehensive knowledge in computer
                science, programming languages, database management, and
                software development. The curriculum was well-structured,
                blending theoretical concepts with practical applications, which
                equipped me with the skills needed to excel in the IT industry.
                I also engaged in various projects and internships, which
                enhanced my problem-solving abilities and understanding of
                real-world challenges. My time at IPS College was instrumental
                in shaping my technical expertise and preparing me for a
                successful career in technology.
              </p>
              <h3>Working on Project</h3>

              <p>
                Creating over 20 projects with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express,
                React, Node.js) can significantly enhance your web development
                skills. Each project can explore different libraries and
                technologies, like Redux for state management, Axios for API
                calls, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and JWT for
                authentication. Projects could range from simple CRUD
                applications to more complex systems like e-commerce platforms,
                social media clones, and real-time chat apps using Socket.io.
                Integrating third-party services like Stripe for payments, AWS
                S3 for file storage, and Passport.js for OAuth can further
                broaden your expertise and prepare you for real-world
                development challenges.
